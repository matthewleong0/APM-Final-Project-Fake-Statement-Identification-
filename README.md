# APM-Final-Project-Fake-Statement-Identification-

This serves as the final project of MIS382N: Advanced Predictive Modeling of the MSBA program at UT Austin.

We aimed to classify statements made by politicians and others sourced from PolitiFact.com by using NLP techniques. We did so using a variety of both traditional machine learning and newer deep learning models. Given the problem, we also explored ways of interpreting our models in order to build trust in them.
